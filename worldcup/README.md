# worldcup
A simple - and not yet complete - Go API wrapper for http://worldcup.sfg.io/,
a nonofficial World Cup API.

This was made to create [`just-scored`][just scored] - a simple serverless app
that sends a Slack notification every time a goal is scored. I only
implemented endpoints that I needed, which is why this isn't in a separate
repository (yet?).

I don't have any immediate plans to add all the remaining resources, but might
do that at some point in the future, especially if there's any need for it.
And needless to say - PRs are more then welcome!
